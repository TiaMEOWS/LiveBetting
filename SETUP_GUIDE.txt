  - Exponential backoff on errors

✓ Analysis Criteria (Need 4/6 + xG checks):
  1. Total shots ≤ 12
  2. Shots on target ≤ 4

✓ Hourly status reports
✓ API quota warnings
✓ Error notifications

CONFIGURATION
-------------
Edit config.py to customize:
- Scan intervals
- Analysis thresholds
- Priority leagues
- API limits

FILES CREATED DURING OPERATION
-------------------------------
- match_tracking.json : Database of analyzed matches
- betting_system.log  : Main system log (rotating, max 10MB)
- errors.log          : Error-specific log (rotating, max 5MB)

MONITORING
----------
The system will:
✓ Send startup notification when launched
✓ Report status every hour
✓ Warn when API quota is running low
✓ Alert on critical errors
✓ Log all activity to files

STOPPING THE SYSTEM
-------------------
Press CTRL+C in the terminal window

API USAGE ESTIMATE
------------------
Base scans/day: 288 (every 5 min) = ~288 requests
Per qualifying match: +3-5 requests (stats, events, form)
Expected daily usage: 500-1,500 requests
Safety buffer: 6,000+ requests remaining

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Q: No alerts being sent?
A: Check that matches are actually in 60-72 min window
   and meet the strict criteria (low xG, defensive stats)

Q: Too many duplicate skip messages?
A: This is normal - prevents re-analyzing same matches

Q: API quota warning?
A: System will automatically throttle. Wait for daily reset.

Q: Connection errors?
A: System will retry with exponential backoff automatically
